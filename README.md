## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to help Hotel Management Inc. better understand the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and higher ratings through an analysis of hotel reviews.

Using a dataset consisting of both positive and negative customer comments along with other details about each stay (e.g., location, length of stay), we predict customer satisfaction based on the Reviewer_Score, where a higher score indicates a more positive experience.
